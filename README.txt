Stock Tracking & Reporting tracks all stock changes, both increases and decreases in your Woocommerce store. 

== Description ==

Track all the stock changes in your Woocommerce store!

This plugin will give you the ability to track all inventory movements both automatic and manual. Store actions that are tracked:

* Sales on orders
* Cancellations on orders
* Increases and decreases in the product pages and quick-edit pages

The premium add-on further extends these capabilities by allowing you to filter search results, adding, editing and deleting transactions, as well as exporting and reporting on the transactions that have been tracked.

Buy the premium version [here](https://innocow.com/software/)

= Core version features include: =

* Viewing the tracked sales, refunds and product inventory increases and decreases in the products pages.

= Premium add-on features include: =

* Searching and filtering the tracked transactions by date, product name, sku, customer email, and order numbers.
* Adding manual transactions for offline sales while keeping the product inventory levels synchronised.
* Generating a monthly report of transactions including the starting and ending balances of each product.
* Printing the reports or exporting them as CSV or TSV.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why aren't I seeing any transactions? =
The plugin can only track the orders and changes that have been made while it is active.

= Why aren't refunded and failed orders tracked? =
By default, Woocommerce does not restock the inventory for orders that have been marked refunded or failed so the plugin doesn't track it either.

= Why can't I edit or delete some transactions? =
It's only possible to make changes to non-linked transactions, or transactions that you have made normally within the plugin. Any transactions that have been synchronised from Woocommerce, such as inventory changes, sales, refunds cannot be modified other than the accompanying note.

= I found a bug! How do I contact you? =
Sorry about that! You can make a post in the Wordpress plugin forum and/or contact us at https://innocow.com/contact.
